# v0.9.0 Execution Map

Snapshot date: 2026-06-04

This map tracks the v0.9.0 integration branch and keeps the open-PR harvest
separate from release publishing. It is a working document: update it whenever a
PR is harvested, superseded, deferred, or closed.

## Live Counts

- Actual open issues: 444
- Open PRs: 54
- Repo API open issue count: 498, because GitHub includes PRs in that total
- Open issues labeled `v0.9.0`: 119
- Open issues without a milestone: 100

## Execution Order

1. Stabilization and PR harvest: finish #2721 and #2722 before new feature work.
2. Provider/model/auth correctness: land narrow correctness fixes that match the
   current provider architecture.
3. File decomposition Phase 1: split safe, test-covered config/provider and TUI
   view surfaces before adding larger workflow UX.
4. WhaleFlow MVP: typed IR, executor skeleton, replay, and pod monitor before
   teacher/student promotion loops.
5. Model Lab and HarnessProfile MVP: Hugging Face polish and provider/model
   posture before automatic harness creation.
6. Release readiness: keep #2729 current and do not tag or publish without
   maintainer approval.

## Current Branch Harvest

Branch: `codex/v0.9.0-stewardship`

The branch contains the previous 22-commit v0.9.0 stack plus these fresh
harvest/stewardship commits:

| PR | Disposition | Evidence / next step |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #2708 Windows sub-agent completion halves TUI render width | Cherry-picked as `e933a11d7`; follow-up fix `72653f8ef` invalidates reused fanout-card rows. | `cargo test -p codewhale-tui --locked subagent`; `cargo test -p codewhale-tui --locked terminal_size`; `cargo clippy -p codewhale-tui --locked -- -D warnings` passed. |
| #2627 Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan mode | Harvested only the auth-header behavior as `5aa68d986`; did not merge the conflicting mode/env changes. | `cargo test -p codewhale-tui --bin codewhale-tui --locked xiaomi_mimo`; `cargo test -p codewhale-secrets --locked xiaomi_mimo`; `cargo test -p codewhale-config --locked xiaomi_mimo`; `cargo clippy -p codewhale-tui --locked -- -D warnings` passed. |
| #2636 project-context mtime cache | Defer direct merge; harvest only after cache key/signature is widened. | Must include constitution changes, auto-generated context deletion, canonical path equivalence, and overwrite detection before landing. |
| #2634 HarmonyOS port | Defer direct merge; draft has broad platform and TLS/runtime blast radius. | Harvest at most the unused `rustyline` cleanup after local verification; full port needs OHOS target checks and sandbox/security review. |
| #2687 append-only mode/approval prompt | Defer direct merge; draft has compile failures and Plan-mode prompt correctness risks. | Any future harvest must keep stable `message[0]` genuinely mode-agnostic, preserve mode/approval suffixes after capacity replans, and distinguish external overrides from persisted generated prompts. |

## PR Harvest Queue

| PR | State | v0.9.0 disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #1865 Pro Plan mode | Conflicting | Likely superseded by HarnessProfile/model-posture lane; review before closing. |
| #1893 TLS certificate verification toggle | Conflicting | Security-sensitive; review separately, not part of first v0.9 harvest. |

## Issue Reduction Strategy

Issue count should drop through evidence-backed consolidation, not bulk closing.

- Close fixed issues only after the v0.9 integration branch is pushed or merged
  and the relevant tests/checks are named in the closure comment.
- Close obsolete release-harvest PRs/issues after verifying no unique commits or
  linked reports remain.
- Supersede older OPENCODE, memory, web, VS Code, and cache-maximalism tickets
  into the current v0.9 lanes when their acceptance criteria are now covered by
  #2667, #2720-#2729, or a narrower current issue.
- Remove or defer `v0.9.0` scope from valid but non-release-critical roadmap
  issues instead of closing them.
- Always credit PR authors, issue reporters, and useful reviewers when a
  contributor branch is harvested.

## Immediate Next Actions

1. Review #2048, #2502, #2509, #2513, #2530, #2576, and #2581 as the next small
   mergeable candidates.
2. Prepare public comments for #2708, #2627, #2634, #2636, #2687, and already-harvested performance
   PRs once this integration branch has a remote review surface.
3. Start file decomposition Phase 1 only after the PR harvest table has no
   unknown high-priority provider/prompt/cache branches.
